# hello-world
Just another repository.
I am a man surrounded by cats. They barf on my carpet in the wee hours of the morning as I lay asleep in bed. Do the cats choose to barf on the tile floor of the kitchen or bathroom? 
No they do not. In an effort to taunt me, they choose to throw up exactly 6 inches from the edge of the tile but definitely, definitely on the carpet.
